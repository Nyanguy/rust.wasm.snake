### WHY?
Well, for fun ofc. This project was an introduction to the **WASM** target platform. However, it was written with [stdweb](https://github.com/koute/stdweb) which is at the time of the current commit seems dead.
Next **WASM** project will be surely written in the pure `WASM_BINGEN` which is the official way to go.

*ok, an embedded call to js via macro with 1 line of code.
